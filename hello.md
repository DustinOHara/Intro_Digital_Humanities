## Course Description

This course is an introduction to the Digital Humanities, its methods, theories, and application. It covers a variety of digital tools and approaches to organize, explore, understand, present and tell stories with data. In this course, you will learn how to reverse engineer DH projects to understand how they were built; identify, use, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different tools and methodologies; develop research questions that can be answered through digital research methods; conduct original research; and build a collaborative digital project. You will also learn how to organize and clean data, develop charts, create spatial and network visualizations, work with a content management system, and use basic text analysis tools to explore qualitative data. Often the best digital humanities projects are the result of collaboration, so you will learn how to work effectively and efficiently in teams as you build project management skills. Each unit will guide you through the development, analysis, and application of the skills listed under the course learning goals. In each unit, you will also critique examples of research projects that employ the methods and/or tools that you are learning.

In addition to the scheduled class meetings, it is necessary for project groups to allocate time outside of class to work on their project. We will discuss ways to organize in person meetings, as well as ways to stay on track through virtual simultaneous and asynchronous group work. No prior experience is necessary, and there are no prerequisites.

## Course Learning Goals

Upon completion of this course, you will demonstrate:

• basic ability to organize and manipulate structured data;

• basic ability to create digital maps;

• basic ability to create data visualizations;

• basic ability to create network graphs;

• the ability to create websites and use content-management systems;

• the ability undertake sophisticated humanistic research;

• the ability to speak, think, and write critically about the epistemological biases and affordances of the methods and tools listed above; and imagine other possibilities for scholarship and inquiry.
